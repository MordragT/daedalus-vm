# daedalus-vm

This is an attempt to rewrite the daedalus vm of the awesome ZenLib

## Why a rewrite ?

Mostly personal reasons, i want to learn how to port c++ librarys to Rust and get better at writing Rust code.
I want to learn more about the ReGoth Project in General, so that i am able to contribute in the future.

## Is this usable ?

No, and it will probably take a while till this changes, at the moment i am just wildly rewriting the code,
but I lack of a deeper understanding of why the code is written like it is. This is just a fun project for me,
so there is a chance I might drop it in the future.
